The entire user experience of Probely is constructed around this specific use-case. We\u2019ve built a product that is sleek and easy to use and allows you to start scanning within five minutes. Issues are exposed along with meticulous instructions on how to fix them. Development and DevOps teams\u2019 security testing becomes less reliant on security teams, more independent, and integrated into the SDLC. Enterprise Edition \u00b6 Probely Enterprise is the top-tier edition of Probely, designed for enterprise companies that manage a large number of attack surfaces across web applications, APIs, and internal targets. In addition to the features you might expect in an enterprise-level platform, such as roles and permissions or single sign-on, we also offer exclusive features. These include standalone API scanning, a separate agent to scan internal targets, a UI that is focused on managing the risks for a large number of targets, and a complete set of integrations with 3rd-party software. We want you to automate security testing in the most efficient way. Integrating security testing into your development processes, from your CI/CD tool to your issue tracker, narrows the gap between development, security, and operations. It makes security an intrinsic part of your web application development life-cycle. And, it means you report on the security vulnerabilities that matter, free of false positives and with accurate instructions on how to fix them.","title":"SMB and Enterprise"},{"location":"editions/#editions-of-probely","text":"","title":"Editions of Probely"},{"location":"editions/#standard-smb-edition","text":"The standard edition of Probely is designed for growing companies that do not have an in-house cybersecurity team and rely on Development or DevOps teams to perform security testing.

We currently have 4 plans: Free , Starter , Pro and Premium : The Free plan let's you assess and improve your security posture with a quick, basic scan to the root of your website. The Starter Plan is best suited for lighter use of Probely, letting you scan your Web Target once a week . The Pro Plan lets you do unlimited scans to your targets, including Single Page Applications and APIs. This plan also let's you integrate Probely with a number of third party platforms . The Premium Plan accumulates the Pro Plan's perks and adds a poolof targets, target rotation and addition/deletion. For a deeper look into the plans perks, visit https://probely.com/pricing/ . Choosing a better plan \u00b6 What is the difference between a target and a pool of targets? \u00b6 When you select the Starter or Pro plan, your subscription is tied to the target\u2019s URL. This means that you can\u2019t delete that target and add a new one under the same subscription. When you select the Premium Plan, your subscription is for five active targets. You are free to delete or add new targets, as long as you don\u2019t exceed the pool size (five slots). Read more. Target \u00b6 When you subscribe a target, under the Starter or Pro plan, your subscription is tied to the target's URL. This means that you can't delete that target and add a new one under the same subscription. If you do that, you'll be unsubscribing the old target and start a new subscription on the new target. Avoid unsubscribing targets, because if you do it in the middle of your billing cycle, you'll be throwing out money . If your application changed to a new URL, contact our support team and we'll be happy to change it for you. Pool of Targets \u00b6 When you are subscribing a pool of Targets (e.g. 5 slots), available in Premium Plan (or Enterprise plans), you're subscribing the right of having 5 active targets. You are free to delete or add new targets, as long as you don't exceed the pool size (the 5 slots). When you delete a target from the pool, you'll be deleting its entire history of vulnerabilities, settings, etc.","title":"Types of Plans"},{"location":"types-of-plans/#types-of-plans","text":"Our product is plan based, and choosing the one that better suits your use-case is an important decision.

Our product lets you extensively scan your web platform in search of any security vulnerabilities it might have. Probely scans a wide realm of vulnerabilities, from XSS and SQL Injections to Missing Headers and Misconfigured Cookies. It will also advise you on how to fix it and show you where said vulnerabilities were found. Why do Devs need Probely? \u00b6 Existing scanning tools are not typically intended for developers. With the explosion of web applications and agile development methodologies, developers must become more adept and independent in accurately assessing their web application and API security. Probely is intended to provide independence, meaning you can test the apps you\u2019re designing earlier in the development process. Scans can be configured to run frequently and automatically \u2013 without the assistance of security professionals. This agility contributes to a faster, and consequently more affordable, development process, while improving your web applications\u2019 overall security posture. Tailored Instructions \u00b6 All scans begin by running a fingerprinting module, which detects all technologies in use, whether they\u2019re out of date and whether they contain known vulnerabilities. Probely will then provide detailed instructions on how to fix the vulnerabilities based on the technologies found in your website applications and APIs. API-first Development Approach \u00b6 Probely follows an API-first development approach. This means that every single feature of Probely is first available on the API and then added to the interface. If we don\u2019t have the integration you need, or if you want to integrate Probely with custom software or workflows, you can always use our API. You can also register account-based or target-based web hooks so that your application is always notified of every Probely event. Integration with CI-CD Tools, Issue Trackers & Messaging Apps \u00b6 Probely integrates with your preferred CI/CD tools, issue trackers, and messaging apps. If, for instance, your development team uses Jira to track issues and Jenkins as the CI/CD tool, you can seamlessly integrate Probely into this existing workflow. Automatically start scans within your CI/CD pipelines and view the vulnerabilities detected by Probely as new issues in Jira. Once the team fixes them and closes the Jira issues, Probely will automatically re-test the vulnerability and reopen the issue on Jira if necessary. It's like having a virtual specialist looking after your app!","title":"What is Probely"},{"location":"what-is-probely/#what-is-probely","text":"Probely is a DAST ( Dynamic Application Security Testing ) scanner, designed to ensure that your webpage becomes safer.
